Project Overview:
This project, "Urban Mobility Data Platform," aims to create a centralized system for collecting, processing, and analyzing various urban mobility datasets (e.g., public transport schedules, real-time vehicle locations, traffic incidents, shared mobility usage). The platform will provide APIs for third-party developers and data analytics dashboards for city planners. Key data sources include GTFS feeds, sensor data from vehicles and infrastructure, and user-generated reports.

Primary Privacy Considerations for this Project:
- Handling of precise geolocation data from users and vehicles.
- Anonymization/pseudonymization of user-linked mobility patterns.
- Ensuring data minimization when providing data to third parties.
- Compliance with GDPR, especially regarding consent for location tracking and data sharing.
- Security of data stores containing potentially sensitive movement data.
