Please provide an overall PII sensitivity assessment for the document named '{document_name}'.
The raw JSON content of the document is as follows:

{raw_json_content}

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FROM INDEXED REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:
---
{additional_rag_context}
---

REFINED TASK BASED ON ALL INFORMATION:
Your primary task is to analyze the raw JSON content of the document named '{document_name}' (provided at the beginning of this prompt, before the 'ADDITIONAL CONTEXT').
Use the 'ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FROM INDEXED REFERENCE DOCUMENTS' (if any was provided and relevant) as background knowledge or reference material to inform your analysis OF THE JSON DOCUMENT.
For example, if the indexed documents contain GDPR definitions, PII examples, or security best practices, use that to better classify PII or assess risks found IN THE JSON DOCUMENT.
Do NOT assume that information from the 'ADDITIONAL CONTEXT' is present in the JSON document unless you find it there directly.

In your PII sensitivity assessment for THE JSON DOCUMENT, please:
1. Identify any PII present IN THE JSON DOCUMENT.
2. Explain your reasoning, highlighting key JSON paths or values from THE JSON DOCUMENT.
3. Conclude with a clear overall PII sensitivity assessment statement for THE JSON DOCUMENT.

Output format: Your entire response must be plain text. Do not use Markdown formatting (no headings, lists, bold/italics, code blocks).
