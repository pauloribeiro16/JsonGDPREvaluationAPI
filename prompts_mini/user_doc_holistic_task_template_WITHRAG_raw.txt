  TASK:
  Considering the **Project Context Overview**, the **Raw JSON Content** of '{document_name}', AND the **Additional Context (from RAG system)** provided above:
  1.  Perform a comprehensive PII sensitivity assessment for the document '{document_name}'.
  2.  Analyze the entire JSON content.
  3.  Explicitly state how the 'Additional Context (from RAG system)' AND the 'Project Context Overview' (if provided and relevant) influenced your PII assessment.
  4.  Determine if the document, as a whole, is likely to contain significant personal data, some personal data, or primarily non-personal data according to GDPR principles, **within the scope of this project.**
  5.  Explain your reasoning in clear, concise natural language paragraphs, highlighting any key JSON paths, values, or insights from the RAG context or project context that lead to your conclusion.
  6.  If the document contains multiple types of sensitive data, or data that becomes sensitive when combined, please mention that.
  7.  Conclude with a clear overall assessment statement and a likelihood (High, Medium, Low) that the document processes personal data subject to GDPR in the context of this project.
